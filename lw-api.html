<h2>The LightWAVE Server Protocol</h2>

<p>
LightWAVE is a lightweight waveform and annotation viewer and editor.  The
LightWAVE client runs within the user's web browser, communicating with the
LightWAVE server, <tt>lightwave</tt>, to obtain raw data that the client
formats and presents to the user.  This technical note describes the protocol
used for communicating with <tt>lightwave</tt>.  It will be of interest to
developers wishing to create custom clients and standalone applications that
make use of <tt>lightwave</tt>.

<p style="color: red">
This note describes only the parts of the protocol that have been
implemented to date.  At this time, LightWAVE's annotation editing capabilities
have not yet been implemented, so this note does not describe any mechanism
for a client to transmit annotations to the LightWAVE server;  extensions
to support this function will be described in a future revision of this
note.</p>

<p>
The LightWAVE server returns data in <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>
format in response to well-formed requests from any client (not limited to the
standard LightWAVE client). A public server is available at
<a href="http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/lightwave">http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/lightwave</a>;
it provides access to all of the 
<a href="http://physionet.org/faq.shtml#physiobank-formats">WFDB-compatible</a>
content in <a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database">PhysioBank</a>.

<p>
The C-language source code for the server is available from the 
<a href="https://physionet.org/works/LightWAVE">LightWAVE</a>
project on PhysioNetWorks (free registration and login required).  The
server can be installed as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a>
application on a web server such
as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, or it can be run as a
command-line application.  For information about installing the
server, see the comments in the <tt>Makefile</tt> for the LightWAVE project.

<p>
Note that <tt>lightwave</tt> is not limited to serving data hosted by
the machine on which it's running, since it reads the data using
the <a href="http://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml">WFDB
library</a>, allowing it to fetch data from other web servers as
needed.  A standard installation of <tt>lightwave</tt> retrieves data
from the server's local storage if available, or from PhysioNet otherwise.

<h3>Requests</h3>

<p>
When accessed via HTTP, requests are passed to <tt>lightwave</tt> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">URL query
strings</a>, as for other CGI applications.  For example,
the <tt>dblist</tt> request can be sent to the public server by
opening
<pre>
    http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/<tt>lightwave</tt>?action=dblist
</pre>
with an HTTP client such as <tt>curl</tt>, <tt>wget</tt>, or any web browser.
More interesting examples appear below.

<p> To use <tt>lightwave</tt> as a command-line application, copy it into a
directory in your <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29">PATH</a>, then supply
an argument when you run it.  Any argument is acceptable, so these commands are
all equivalent:

<pre>
     lightwave -i
     lightwave hello
     lightwave I-want-a-pizza-to-go-with-no-anchovies
</pre>

In command-line mode, <tt>lightwave</tt> prompts for parameters as needed,
beginning with <tt>action</tt> (see below).  Type the value of each parameter,
ending your answer with a newline (press 'Enter').  For parameters that can
have multiple values (such as <tt>signal</tt>, see below) you will given
multiple prompts; enter one value at each prompt, and indicate the end of the
set of values by entering a newline only.

<p>
To use <tt>lightwave</tt> within a script, make an interactive test run and
keep track of what you need to type in response to <tt>lightwave</tt>'s
prompts in order to obtain the data your script will require.  Then create a
plain text file containing your responses in the correct order, and use your
script to supply the contents of this file to <tt>lightwave</tt> via its
standard input; see the
<tt>lw-test</tt> script in the source directory for an example.

<p>
<b>Parameters</b>

<p>
When interacting with <tt>lightwave</tt>, the <tt>action</tt> parameter
(see the next section) specifies the request type.  Depending on the
<tt>action</tt>, one or more of these parameters may be needed to specify the
data of interest:

<dl>
<dt>db</dt>
<dd>The (short form) name of the data collection (database), such as
<tt>edb</tt> (the short form name for the European ST-T Database).
Short form names of all of the PhysioBank databases are given in the
first column of
<a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/DBS">http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/DBS</a>.
</dd>

<dt>record</dt>
<dd>The record name.</dd>

<dt>signal</dt>
<dd>A signal number.  Signals are numbered 0, 1, 2 ... in each record.</dd>

<dt>annotator</dt>
<dd>An annotator name.</dd>

<dt>t0</dt>
<dd>The starting time (the time interval from the beginning of the record to
the first sample or annotation of interest).  The value of this parameter can
be given in seconds, or as a string in H:M:S format.  For records longer than
24 hours, the string may be written as DdH:M:S, where D is the number of days.
Examples: 100 (1 minute 40 seconds); 30:25 (30 minutes 25 seconds); 10:15:20
(10 hours 15 minutes 20 seconds); 3d02:01:00 (3 days 2 hours 1 minute).</dd>

<dt>dt</dt>
<dd>The duration of the time interval of interest.  As for t0, this parameter
can be given in seconds or as a string.  Avoid specifying a duration longer
than 1 minute, however, when using the public <tt>lightwave</tt> server.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<b>Request types</b>

<p>
The request type is passed as the value of <tt>action</tt>, and must be
one of:

<dl>
<dt>dblist</dt>
<dd>Get the list of databases (data collections).  Any other parameters
passed in the same request are ignored.
</dd>

<dt>rlist</dt>
<dd>Get the list of records within a database specified by the <tt>db</tt>
parameter.</dd>

<dt>alist</dt>
<dd>Get the list of annotators within a database specified by the <tt>db</tt>
parameter.</dd>

<dt>info</dt>
<dd>Get the metadata, including signal names, gains, and sampling
frequencies, for a record specified by the <tt>db</tt> and <tt>record</tt>
parameters.</dd>

<dt>fetch</dt> <dd>Retrieve data from a record specified by the
<tt>db</tt> and <tt>record</tt> parameters.  Specify the signal(s) and
annotator(s) of interest using the <tt>signal</tt> and
<tt>annotator</tt> parameters, and specify the time interval of
interest using the <tt>t0</tt> (starting time) parameter and the
<tt>dt</tt> (duration) parameter.

</dd>
</dl>

</pre>

<p>The <tt>treq</tt> field indicates the number of clock ticks per second,
which is the least common multiple of the sampling frequency of the signals
included in the record.  In most records, all signals are sampled at
<tt>tfreq</tt>, and the <tt>tps</tt> (ticks per sample) field is 1 for each
signal.  In multifrequency records, including most EDF-format records, one or
more signals is sampled at a lower frequency, and <tt>tps</tt> is greater than
1 for these signals.</p>

<p>If the <tt>start</tt> and <tt>end</tt> times are bracketed, as in the example
above, they indicate the times of day when the recording began and ended.  For
many recordings, this information is unavailable, and in such cases
<tt>start</tt> and <tt>end</tt> are <tt>null</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>units</tt> field is a string that indicates the physical units of
the signal, if known (or <tt>null</tt> if unknown).  The <tt>base</tt> is the
value (in raw units) that corresponds to 0 physical units, and the <tt>gain</tt>
is the number of raw units per physical units.  (See the next example.)

<p>The <tt>adcres</tt> and <tt>adczero</tt> fields specify the number of significant bits per sample (the analog-to-digital converter resolution) and the
center of the range (typically zero except for offset binary converters).

</pre>

<p>The arrays of <tt>signal</tt> and <tt>annotator</tt> objects will be
omitted if no signals or annotators are requested.

<p>In the <tt>signal</tt> objects, the <tt>name</tt>, <tt>units</tt>,
<tt>gain</tt>, <tt>base</tt>, and <tt>tps</tt> fields are as described in the
previous example.  The <tt>t0</tt> and <tt>tf</tt> fields indicate the sequence
number of the first sample in the <tt>samp</tt> array and the sequence number
of the sample that follows the last sample in the array; sequence numbers begin
with 0.  The <tt>scale</tt> field indicates the conventional display scale for
the signal in physical units per cm.  The first element of each <tt>samp</tt>
array is the amplitude of sample <tt>t0</tt> of the signal in raw units; the
remaining elements are the first differences (i.e., the amplitude of sample
<tt>t0</tt>+<em>n</em> is the sum of the first <em>n+1</em> elements).

<blockquote> <em>In the example above, the first few elements of the second
<tt>samp</tt> array are -515, 0, 0, 1, 0, and -2.  The reconstructed raw samples
are -515, -515, -515, -514, -514, and -516.  To convert these raw
amplitudes into arterial blood pressure ("ART") measurements in physical units
("mmHg"), subtract the <tt>base</tt> (-1147) and divide by the <tt>gain</tt>
(7.72857) to get 81.775 ([(-512)-(-1147)]*7.72857), 81.775, 81.775, 81.904,
81.904, and 81.645.

<p>To determine the times of these samples, first note that the requested start
time (15 minutes following the start of the record) matches <tt>t0</tt>
(225000), and that <tt>tps</tt> is 1 for the BP signal (as it is for the other
signals); thus the sampling frequency of the BP signal is 225000/(15*60), or
250 samples per second, and the times of the six samples are 15:00, 15:00.004,
15:00.008, 15:00.012, 15:00.016, and 15:00.020.</em> </blockquote>

<p>Although passing samples as first differences in raw amplitude units
requires a modest amount of computation by the client to convert to physical
units, difference data in (integer) raw units can be transmitted 2 to 5 times
faster than data in scaled units and, more significantly, this method does not
introduce floating-point errors that may accumulate in client-side digital
signal processing such as filtering and power spectral analysis.

<p> In the <tt>annotator</tt> objects, the <tt>name</tt> field specifies the
annotator name, and the <tt>annotation</tt> array contains the individual
annotations associated with that annotator.  In the annotations,
the <tt>t</tt>, <tt>a</tt>, <tt>s</tt>, <tt>c</tt>, <tt>n</tt>, and <tt>x</tt>
fields are the time, annotation type (mnemonic), subtype, "chan", "num", and
"aux" fields of the WFDB annotation structures.  See the section
titled <em>Annotation Structures</em> in
the <a href="http://physionet.org/physiotools/wpg/">WFDB Programmer's Guide</a>
for definitions of these fields.  The standard annotation type mnemonics are
defined
in <a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/annotations.shtml">PhysioBank
Annotations</a>;  non-standard types are described on the home pages of the
databases in which they are found.

<blockquote><em>In the example above, the three annotations belonging to
annotator <tt>ecg</tt> are all of type '<tt>N</tt>', representing normal QRS
complexes in the ECG.  The home page for the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database
notes that annotator <tt>st</tt> contains sleep stage annotations of type
'<tt>"</tt>' (in JSON notation, shown as <tt>"\""</tt>), with a sleep stage
mnemonic in the <tt>x</tt> field (<tt>W</tt> in the example, signifying
wakefulness).</em></blockquote>

</ul>

<h3>JSONP</h3>

<p>
The LightWAVE server looks in its parameter list for a <tt>callback</tt>
parameter.  If present, the server takes the value of <tt>callback</tt>
as the name of a function, and "wraps" its JSON output within an invocation
of the function.  Thus, if the value of <tt>callback</tt> were <tt>foo</tt>,
the output would appear as
<pre>
foo(<em style="color: blue">... {JSON output} ...</em>)
</pre>
This form of output is called JSONP, and it is supported so that clients
hosted on other machines can interact with the LightWAVE server.  Such
cross-domain communication would otherwise be disallowed by modern browsers.
See <a href="client-install.html">Installing a local copy of the LightWAVE
client</a> for information about setting up a testbed for development and
customization without the overhead of running a local web server.
