<h2>Explore this record using LightWAVE</h2>

<p> <b>LightWAVE</b> is a lightweight waveform and annotation viewer and editor.
Use it to explore the record named in the upper right corner.  Use your web
browser's <b>Back</b> button to return to the previous page when you're
finished.

<p>
On the <b>View/edit</b> tab, you can see a 10-second excerpt of the record
named in the upper right corner.  The time indicators along the lower edge
of the plot indicate the elapsed time from the beginning of the record,
in hours, minutes, and seconds.

<p>
View any other location in the record using the navigation controls along the
top of the <b>View/edit</b> tab.  For example, enter a time in the box next
to <b>Go to:</b>, then click (tap) <b>Plot</b>.

<p> To find out how any LightWAVE control works, move the pointer over it,
and a tooltip with a brief description will appear after a short
interval.

<p> Click on any of the labels on the left side of the <b>View/edit</b> tab
to remove that item from the plot.  Click again to restore it.  This feature
may be useful if there are many signals or annotations, or if you have an
unusually slow network connection.

<p> If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel or a multitouch trackpad or screen,
point to any location in the plot and scroll or "pinch" to change the
magnification.

<p> View details about the record, including text representations of the
annotations and digitized signals, on the <b>Tables</b> tab.

<p> When your browser loads this page, not all of LightWAVE's controls are
available; for example, you cannot select a different record to view.  To
access all of LightWAVE's features, visit
