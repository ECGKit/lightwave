<h2>LightWAVE bug list</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Signals not visible/not centered.</b><br>
There are at least three bugs that cause this symptom:
<ul>
<li> In records that have no signals (e.g., crisdb records) a null response
from the server is not handled properly in the client.
<li> In records with incorrectly specified adczero (e.g., qtdb/sel100),
the signals may be rendered off-screen.
<li> In records with sampling frequencies less than 0.1 Hz, there is at
most one sample in the window, and nothing is drawn as a result.
</ul>

<li><b>LightWAVE doesn't work in Internet Explorer.</b><br>
Yes, it does.  But unless you have IE 9 or 10, you <em>must</em> install
the free <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">Google Chrome
Frame</a> plugin.

<li><b>Can't go to times that are not multiples of 10 seconds.</b><br>
This is not a bug.  It will be possible to set a location with
finer resolution when smooth scrolling is implemented.

<li><b>MIMIC II Waveform Database "numerics" records are missing.</b><br>
LightWAVE needs a record submenu, like the PhysioBank ATM has.

</ul>
