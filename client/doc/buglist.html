<h2>LightWAVE bug list</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Some signals are not visible.</b><br>
At least two samples of a given signal must fall within the signal window
in order for the signal to appear.  For signals sampled at very low rates,
this condition may not be satisfied.  Increase the window duration using
the slider at the lower right corner of the <b>View/edit</b> tab.

<li><b>Autoplay freezes after >10 minutes.</b><br>
It may have been possible to fill the trace pool with redundant copies of
the same, or nearly the same, data segment, thereby locking out any attempt
to fetch the next data segment.  Changes in the prefetch strategy in version
0.46 make this very unlikely.  Exit the browser and reopen the record if this
problem recurs.

<li><b>LightWAVE doesn't work in Internet Explorer.</b><br>
Yes, it does.  But unless you have IE 9 or 10, you <em>must</em> install
the free <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">Google Chrome
Frame</a> plugin.  The plugin is recommended but not required for IE 9.

<li><b>MIMIC II Waveform Database "numerics" records are missing.</b><br>
LightWAVE needs a record submenu, like the PhysioBank ATM has.
</ul>
