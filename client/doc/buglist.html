<h2>LightWAVE bug list</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Signals not visible/not centered.</b><br>
There are at least four bugs that cause this symptom:
<ul>
<li> <s>In records that have no signals (e.g., crisdb records) a null response
from the server is not handled properly in the client.</s>
<li> <s>In records with incorrectly specified adczero (e.g., qtdb/sel100),
the signals may be rendered off-screen.</s>
<li> In records with sampling frequencies less than 0.1 Hz, there is at
most one sample in the window, and nothing is drawn as a result.
<li> <s>If the signal name contains a "+" (or other characters that have
special meanings in query strings, such as "#", "%", "?", "/", "&", "!")
the signal name will be mangled in transit to the server, and the server won't
retrieve samples of it.</s>
</ul>

<li><b>LightWAVE doesn't work in Internet Explorer.</b><br>
Yes, it does.  But unless you have IE 9 or 10, you <em>must</em> install
the free <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">Google Chrome
Frame</a> plugin.

<li><b><s>Can't go to times that are not multiples of 10 seconds.</s></b><br>

<li><b>MIMIC II Waveform Database "numerics" records are missing.</b><br>
LightWAVE needs a record submenu, like the PhysioBank ATM has.

</ul>
