<h2>LightWAVE bug list</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>The Tables panel doesn't always show all of the samples in the signal
window.</b><br>
The implementation of autoplay mode required modifications to the code for
collecting samples that have been read from the server.  These modifications
have been made in the View/edit code, but not yet in the Tables code.

<li><b>Signals not visible/not centered.</b><br>
In records with sampling frequencies less than 0.1 Hz, there is at
most one sample in the window, and nothing is drawn as a result.

<li><b>Autoplay freezes after >10 minutes.</b><br>
It may have been possible to fill the trace pool with redundant copies of
the same, or nearly the same, data segment, thereby locking out any attempt
to fetch the next data segment.  Changes in the prefetch strategy in version
0.46 make this very unlikely.  Exit the browser and reopen the record if this
problem recurs.

<li><b>LightWAVE doesn't work in Internet Explorer.</b><br>
Yes, it does.  But unless you have IE 9 or 10, you <em>must</em> install
the free <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">Google Chrome
Frame</a> plugin.

<li><b>MIMIC II Waveform Database "numerics" records are missing.</b><br>
LightWAVE needs a record submenu, like the PhysioBank ATM has.
