<h2>About LightWAVE</h2>

<p> <b>LightWAVE</b> is a lightweight waveform and annotation viewer and
editor.  Use it to view any of the recordings of physiologic signals and time
series in <a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">PhysioBank</a>,
together with their annotations (event markers).

<p> LightWAVE runs within <a href="browser-compatibility.html">any modern web
browser</a> and does not require installation on the user's computer, tablet, or
phone.  LightWAVE is free software licensed under
the <a href="COPYING.html">GPL</a>.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<ol>
<li> On the <b>Choose input</b> tab, select one of PhysioBank's databases.
(Learn more about them in PhysioBank's
<a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">index</a>.)

<li> Once you have chosen a database, a <b>Record</b> selector appears.  Choose
a record.

<li> On the <b>View/edit</b> tab, click on <b>Plot</b>.  The first 10 seconds
of the record appears.  Use the other controls at the top of the
<b>View/edit</b> tab to navigate to other locations in the record.
</ol>

<p> To find out how any LightWAVE control works, move the pointer over it,
and a tooltip with a brief description will appear after a short
interval.

<p> Click on any of the labels on the left side of the <b>View/edit</b> tab
to remove that item from the plot.  Click again to restore it.  This feature
may be useful if there are many signals or annotations, or if you have an
unusually slow network connection.

<p> If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel or a multitouch trackpad or screen,
point to any location in the plot and scroll or "pinch" to change the
magnification.

<p> View details about the record, including text representations of the
annotations and digitized signals, on the <b>Tables</b> tab.

<p> Use the controls on the <b>Settings</b> tab to modify LightWAVE's
behavior.  Your changes persist until LightWAVE is reloaded.

<p>
On the <b>View/edit</b> tab, use the <b>Find...</b> button to specify a search
target (a type of annotation to be found), then use the <b>&lt;&nbsp;Search</b>
and <b>Search&nbsp;&gt;</b> buttons to find the previous or next occurrence of
the target.  Clicking on <b>Find...</b> opens a dialog box;  enter an
annotation mnemonic, such as N, V, or A, and choose an annotation set to search
if more than one set is available.
