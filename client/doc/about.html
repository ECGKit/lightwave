<h2>About LightWAVE</h2>

<p> <b>LightWAVE</b> is a lightweight waveform and annotation viewer and
editor.  Use it to view any of the recordings of physiologic signals and time
series in <a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">PhysioBank</a>,
together with their annotations (event markers).

<p> LightWAVE runs within <a href="browser-compatibility.html">any modern web
browser</a> and does not require installation on the user's computer, tablet, or
phone.  LightWAVE is free software licensed under
the <a href="COPYING.html">GPL</a>.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<ol>
<li> On the <b>Choose input</b> tab, select one of PhysioBank's databases.
(Learn more about them in PhysioBank's
<a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">index</a>.)

<li> Once you have chosen a database, a <b>Record</b> selector appears.  Choose
a record.

<li> On the <b>View/edit</b> tab, click on <b>Plot</b>.  The first 10 seconds
of the record appears.  Use the other controls at the top of the
<b>View/edit</b> tab to navigate to other locations in the record.
</ol>

<p> To find out how any LightWAVE control works, move the pointer over it,
and a tooltip with a brief description will appear after a short
interval.

<p> Click on any of the labels on the left side of the <b>View/edit</b> tab
to remove that item from the plot.  Click again to restore it.  This feature
may be useful if there are many signals or annotations, or if you have an
unusually slow network connection.

<p> If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel or a multitouch trackpad or screen,
point to any location in the plot and scroll or "pinch" to change the
magnification.

<p> View details about the record, including text representations of the
annotations and digitized signals, on the <b>Tables</b> tab.

<p> Use the controls on the <b>Settings</b> tab to modify LightWAVE's
behavior.  Your changes persist until LightWAVE is reloaded.

<p>
On the <b>View/edit</b> tab, use the <b>Find...</b> button to specify a search
target (a type of annotation to be found), then use the <b>&lt;&nbsp;Search</b>
and <b>Search&nbsp;&gt;</b> buttons to find the previous or next occurrence of
the target.  Clicking on <b>Find...</b> opens a dialog box;  enter an
annotation mnemonic, such as N, V, or A, and choose an annotation set to search
if more than one set is available.

<hr>

<p> LightWAVE is modelled on WAVE, an X11/XView application I wrote and
maintained between 1989 and 2012.  This is an alpha version of LightWAVE, which
I wrote as a testbed and proof-of-concept.  It provides a way to select and
extract data from PhysioBank records and to view them as annotated waveforms or
in text form.  The current version does not provide editing functions, and it
provides only limited navigation controls.

<p> <b>LightWAVE's data repository</b> is
<a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">PhysioBank</a> by default,
or any set of files structured as in PhysioBank (with <tt>DBS</tt>,
<tt>RECORDS</tt>, and <tt>ANNOTATORS</tt> text indices and WFDB-compatible
binary data files).

<p> <b>LightWAVE's back end</b> is a CGI application written in C for speed and
efficiency.  It retrieves data from its data repository and delivers them in
response to requests generated by the front end.  It has been tested
successfully using Apache (on Fedora 64-bit Linux and Ubuntu 32-bit Linux); it
does not have explicit system dependencies and should be usable with Apache
(and, possibly, with other web servers) on other platforms.  The back end can
also be run as an interactive or scripted command-line application for testing,
debugging, and possibly other purposes I haven't dreamed up just yet.  The
source package contains a shell script (<tt>lw-test</tt>) that demonstrates
command-line usage.  The API is designed to ease development of alternative
front ends with the aim of encouraging experimentation.

<p> <b>LightWAVE's front end</b> is a web application written in JavaScript.
It will be substantially revised before the initial public release, which is
planned for January 2013.  Optimum buzzword compliance, browser independence,
and general cross-platform goodness, are achieved via HTML5, CSS, and
JavaScript/jQuery-generated Ajax requests for JSON-formatted data transformed
into SVG elements that are dynamically injected into the DOM.

<p> LightWAVE's data repository, back end, and front end can be located on the
same computer or on separate computers.  (The data repository may be split
across multiple computers.)
