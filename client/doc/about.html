<b>LightWAVE</b> is a lightweight waveform and annotation viewer and editor.

<p>
LightWAVE is modelled on WAVE, an X11/XView application I wrote and maintained
between 1989 and 2012.  LightWAVE runs within <a
href="browser-compatibility.html">any modern web browser</a> and does not
require installation on the user's computer.  LightWAVE is free software
licensed under the <a href="COPYING.html">GPL</a>.

<p>
This is an alpha version of LightWAVE, which I wrote as a testbed and
proof-of-concept.  It provides a way to select and extract data from PhysioBank
records and to view them as annotated waveforms or in text form.  The current
version does not provide editing functions, and it provides only limited
navigation controls.

<p>
<b>LightWAVE's back end</b> is a CGI application written in C for speed and
efficiency.  It delivers data in response to requests generated by the front
end, and it is usable now.  It has been tested successfully using Apache (on
Fedora 64-bit Linux and Ubuntu 32-bit Linux); it does not have explicit system
dependencies and should be usable with Apache (and, possibly, with other web
servers) on other platforms.  The back end can also be run as an interactive or
scripted command-line application for testing, debugging, and possibly other
purposes I haven't dreamed up just yet.  The source package contains a shell
script (<tt>lw-test</tt>) that demonstrates command-line usage.  The API is
designed to ease development of alternative front ends with the aim of
encouraging experimentation.

<p> 
<b>LightWAVE's front end</b> will be substantially revised before the initial
public release, which is planned for January 2013.  It currently includes a GUI
for selecting data structured as in PhysioBank (with <tt>DBS</tt>,
<tt>RECORDS</tt>, and <tt>ANNOTATORS</tt> text indices and WFDB-compatible
binary data files).  Optimum buzzword compliance, browser independence, and
general cross-platform goodness, are achieved via HTML5, CSS, and
JavaScript/jQuery-generated Ajax requests for JSON-formatted data transformed
into SVG elements that are dynamically injected into the DOM.  It has been
tested successfully using Chrome (on Linux, Mac OS X, and MS Windows), Firefox
(on Linux, Mac OS X, MS Windows, and on an Android mobile phone), MSIE 9 (on MS
Windows), Opera (on Linux, Mac OS X, and MS Windows), and Safari (on Mac OS X
and MS Windows).  Its graphics cannot be viewed using MSIE 8 or earlier
versions, or using the standard Android browser (because these browsers don't
support SVG graphics).

<p>
<b>LightWAVE's documentation</b> includes a description of its <a
href="lw-api.html">server protocol</a> for developers of custom clients and
standalone applications.  Another page describes <a
href="client-install.html">how to install the LightWAVE client locally</a> in
order to provide a testbed for customization.  Other documentation is currently
limited to comments embedded in its source files (especially its
<tt>Makefile</tt>) and this file).  Sources are available in the LightWAVE
project on PhysioNetWorks.
