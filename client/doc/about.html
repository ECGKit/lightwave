<p> <b>LightWAVE</b> is a lightweight waveform and annotation viewer and editor.

<p> LightWAVE is modelled on WAVE, an X11/XView application I wrote and
maintained between 1989 and 2012.  LightWAVE runs within <a
href="browser-compatibility.html">any modern web browser</a> and does not
require installation on the user's computer.  LightWAVE is free software
licensed under the <a href="COPYING.html">GPL</a>.

<p> This is an alpha version of LightWAVE, which I wrote as a testbed and
proof-of-concept.  It provides a way to select and extract data from PhysioBank
records and to view them as annotated waveforms or in text form.  The current
version does not provide editing functions, and it provides only limited
navigation controls.

<p> <b>LightWAVE's back end</b> is a CGI application written in C for speed and
efficiency.  It delivers data in response to requests generated by the front
end.  It has been tested successfully using Apache (on Fedora 64-bit Linux and
Ubuntu 32-bit Linux); it does not have explicit system dependencies and should
be usable with Apache (and, possibly, with other web servers) on other
platforms.  The back end can also be run as an interactive or scripted
command-line application for testing, debugging, and possibly other purposes I
haven't dreamed up just yet.  The source package contains a shell script
(<tt>lw-test</tt>) that demonstrates command-line usage.  The API is designed to
ease development of alternative front ends with the aim of encouraging
experimentation.

<p> <b>LightWAVE's front end</b> will be substantially revised before the
initial public release, which is planned for January 2013.  It currently
includes a GUI for selecting data structured as in PhysioBank (with
<tt>DBS</tt>, <tt>RECORDS</tt>, and <tt>ANNOTATORS</tt> text indices and
WFDB-compatible binary data files).  Optimum buzzword compliance, browser
independence, and general cross-platform goodness, are achieved via HTML5, CSS,
and JavaScript/jQuery-generated Ajax requests for JSON-formatted data
transformed into SVG elements that are dynamically injected into the DOM.
