<h2>Editing annotations with LightWAVE</h2>

<p style="color: red">
This page describes features that are not yet implemented in LightWAVE!
</p>

<b>Uploading annotations to PhysioNet</b>

<p>
We welcome contributions of corrected and supplementary annotations for
PhysioBank's data collections (databases).  We review all such contributions
before posting them, with acknowledgement to their contributors.  Similarly,
many owners of PhysioNetWorks projects encourage such contributions to their
projects.

<p>
Simplifying the process of contributing annotations to PhysioBank and to
PhysioNetWorks projects is a major motivation for the development of LightWAVE.
When annotation editing is implemented in LightWAVE, here's how it will work:

<ol>
<li> You will need to identify yourself by logging in to your PhysioNetWorks
account.  (If you don't have an account, LightWAVE will guide you through the
brief process of creating one.)

<li> Once logged in, select a record to edit, either from PhysioBank or
from any PhysioNetWorks project of which you are a member.  You may edit an
existing annotation file, or you may create a new one.

<li> As you edit, LightWAVE will upload your edits automatically into your
personal workspace on PhysioNetWorks, where they will be accessible only
to you.   You will be able to access them again in future editing
sessions, and may revise or add to them if desired.  (If you edit an
existing annotation file, your edits will be saved as a copy, and the
original file will be unchanged, unless you are the owner of the original
file.)

<li>
When you are finished with a set of annotations, you may mark them
as final within LightWAVE.   At that time, LightWAVE will copy them
to the PhysioNetWorks project associated with the record, where they will
be visible to the members of the project.  (There will be a single project
for annotations of data collections that are already public in PhysioBank.)

<li> The project owner will review your annotations.  If you are the project
owner, you will find the annotations in a "to be reviewed" group.  If the
annotations are corrections to an existing file that you own, you may view
and approve or reject each correction individually, or you may replace the
entire existing file with the corrected version of it.
